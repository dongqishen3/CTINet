# CTINet: A Feature Interaction Network Integrating Transformer Modules for Partial-to-Partial Point Cloud Registration


## Abstract
Point cloud registration is a critical task in computer vision and robotics. Existing partial-overlap registration methods typically rely heavily on the precise estimation of overlapping regions; consequently, poor overlap extraction significantly degrades registration accuracy. To address this limitation, this paper proposes CTINet, a novel partial-to-partial registration method that eliminates the need for overlap detection or explicit mask estimation by incorporating multi-level feature interactions between the source and reference point clouds directly into the convolutional feature extraction stage. Specifically, CTINet employs a dual-branch feature interaction network, embedding multiple data-association modules within the feature extraction process to enhance inter-cloud correlations. Furthermore, these modules integrate both self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, further improving feature alignment accuracy. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that CTINet outperforms OMNetâ€”the top-performing baseline among seven evaluated methodsâ€”achieving reductions of approximately 8.86%, 18.1%, and 22.7% in RMSE(R), Error(R), and Error(t), respectively.
